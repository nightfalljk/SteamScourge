## Steam Scourge

This is the source code for the game Steam Scourge.

Steam Scourge is a first-person narrative exploration game. You are trapped in a disease-ridden walled-off district trying to make a quick buck when it all goes south.

A build version can be found at: https://hafrass.itch.io/steam-scourge

The game was developed over the course of 14 weeks for the Game World Design course at IT University of Copenhagen.
